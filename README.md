# About Me
Hello! I am Gavin Alford and i create games with the Source Engine. I mainly use C++ to create my programs and games but sometimes experiment with other scripting languages. I might be busy all the time since i have stuff to do. I love uploading random shit to GitHub sometimes, incase ya know if people want it or not.
